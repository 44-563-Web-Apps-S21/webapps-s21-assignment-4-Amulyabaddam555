    <h3>All's Well That Ends Well</h3>
    <h4>SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.</h4>
    <p class= "stage-direction">Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black</p>

    <h6 class= "name">COUNTESS</h6>
<p class="speech countess">In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</p>
<h6 class="name">BERTRAM</h6>
<p class="speech bertram">And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</p>
<h6 class="name">LAFEU</h6>
<p class="speech lafeu">You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
than lack it where there is such abundance.</p>
<h6 class="name">COUNTESS</h6>
<p class="speech countess">What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?</p>
<h6 class="name">LAFEU</h6>
<p class="speech lafeu">He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
finds no other advantage in the process but only the
losing of hope by time.</p>
<h6 class="name">COUNTESS</h6>
<p class="speech countess">This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
far, would have made nature immortal, and death
should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
the death of the king's disease.</p>
<h6 class="name">LAFEU</h6>
<p class="speech lafeu">How called you the man you speak of, madam?</p>
<h6 class="name">COUNTESS</h6>
<p class="speech countess">He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.</p>
<h6 class="name">LAFEU</h6>
<p class="speech lafeu">He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
could be set up against mortality.</p>
<h6 class="name">BERTRAM</h6>
<p class="speech bertram">What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?</p>
